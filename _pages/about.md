Hi there,

I am Maria O’Farrell. I am a pediatric occupational therapist and first time mom. I am extremely passionate about development and often find myself wondering what signs of developmental delay, sensory processing disorders, and neurobiological disorders could have been recognized in utero and in early development. I am creating this blog to bridge the gap between parents and pediatric therapists alike and provide information and realistic suggestions for parents who are navigating the chaos of parenthood.

I graduated with my BS in health sciences in 2014 and my MS in occupational therapy in 2017. Since then, I have been working in an outpatient pediatric clinic and have tailored my continuing education primarily in sensory integration and reflex integration. With this level of clinical experience and education I hope to empower parents who are constantly battling their own intuition against their therapists’ suggestions and interpretation. Mothering and parenting are their own occupations and should be recognized as such. I hope this familial approach is beneficial, insightful, and humbling. Thanks for following along!
